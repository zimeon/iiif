*iiif* - IIIF Image API reference implementation and Python library.
Supports the `International Image Interoperability Framework
<http://iiif.io/>`_: Image API
`2.1
<http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/>`_ and
`3.0
<http://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/>`_ (as well as legacy versions
`2.0
<http://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/>`_,
`1.1
<http://iiif.io/api/image/1.1/>`_,
`1.0
<http://iiif.io/api/image/1.0/>`_).
Also includes a test server using the library to implement the Image
API transformations dynamically, and a static file generator to
pre-compute tiles necessary for OpenSeadragon which may then be
stored a static files.

Installation
------------

The library, test server, static file generator are all designed to
work with recent versions of Python 3 and Python 2.7. Manual installation
is necessary to get the demonstration documentation and examples.

**Automatic installation from PyPI**

The *iiif* library code and scripts are available from `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iiif>`_ and can be installed with
``pip``, e.g.::

    pip install iiif

The PyPI version does not include all demonstration documentation and
examples.

**Manual installation from github**

First, clone the code and examples from the `Github repository
<https://github.com/zimeon/iiif>`_::

    cd /tmp
    git clone git://github.com/zimeon/iiif.git
    cd iiif/

Second, install ``Pillow`` (a fork of ``PIL``)::

    pip install Pillow

You may need ``sudo`` if installing system-wide as opposed to in a user-space
environment.

After installation of ``Pillow`` there will be be a summary of image formats
supported. Addition libraries may be require to get all formats depending
on your platform.

The scripts and demonstrations can then be run from the `iiif` directory.

Finally, you may install the library code and scripts locally in the
appropriate places within your python setup using::

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

- You may need ``sudo`` to if installing system-wide as opposed to in a user-space environment
