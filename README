*iiif* - A Python library providing a reference implementation
of the `International Image Interoperability Framework
<http://iiif.io/>`_: Image API
`2.1
<http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/>`_ (and versions
`2.0
<http://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/>`_,
`1.1
<http://iiif.io/api/image/1.1/>`_, 
`1.0
<http://iiif.io/api/image/1.0/>`_).
Also includes a test server using the library to implement the Image
API transformations dynamically, and a static file generator to
pre-compute tiles necessary for OpenSeadragon which may then be
stored a static files.

Installation
------------

The library, test server, static file generator are all designed to
work with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6. Manual installation is 
necessary to get the demonstration documentation and examples.

**Automatic installation from PyPI**

The *iiif* library code and scripts are listed in `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iiif>`_ and can be installed with 
``pip`` or ``easy_install``, e.g.:: 

    easy_install iiif

The PyPI version does not include all demonstration documentation and
examples.

**Manual installation from github**

First, clone the code and examples from the `Github repository
<https://github.com/zimeon/iiif>`_::

    cd /tmp
    git clone git://github.com/zimeon/iiif.git
    cd iiif/

Second, install ``Pillow`` (a fork of ``PIL``)::

    pip install 'Pillow<4.0.0'

- Pillow is tied to <4.0.0 to remain compatible with python 2.6. This code may work with later versions but is not being tested with them
- You may need ``sudo`` if installing system-wide as opposed to in a user-space environment

After installation of ``Pillow`` there will be be a summary of image formats
supported. Addition libraries may be require to get all formats depending
on your platform.

The scripts and demonstrations can then be run from the `iiif` directory.

Finally, you may install the library code and scripts locally in the 
appropriate places within your python setup using::

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

- You may need ``sudo`` to if installing system-wide as opposed to in a user-space environment

The source code is maintained on `Github
<https://github.com/zimeon/iiif>`_
